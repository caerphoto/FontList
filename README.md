# FontList

Super simple app that lists each font on your system along with a customisable
preview.

My first Mac app, so the code is probably terrible. I'm still not really sure
what I'm doing, but it seems to be working.

# TODO

* bold/italic checkboxes
* a nice icon (or even a bad one, anything but the default)
* fix jankiness and other performance issues
* more preview options (multi-line, for example)
